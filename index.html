    <section id="about">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am doctoral researcher with a background in acoustic phonetics. I investigate how infants discover, explore and learn the speech sounds of their first language. To do this, use techniques from acoustic phonetics. Bayesian
        statistics, meta-science and big-team science. If you are interested in having a chat, I'd love to hear from you.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>My research looks at interactive dynamics between infants and caregivers during language acquisition. One part of the equation concerns how caregivers adapt the acoustic features of their speech when talking to their infants (IDS). Another part of the equation revolves around the interactive dynamics between caregiver and infant, where each interactant reciprocally affect each other. There is no better domain to look at this than in turn-taking. Lastly, the infant should not be considered a passive agent in his or her own process of language development, and my research also looks at the active role played by the infant in exploring and systematising speech sounds</p>

            <h3>Turn-Taking</h3>
            <p>Here I'm interested in the reciprocal relationships between caregivers and infants. We know that the response latencies of caregivers and infants are mutually dependent on each other, and we're doing our very best at modelling this process in a Bayesian framework</p>
